## Background

Below is copied from [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-10-07/readme.md).

This week we’re exploring EuroLeague Basketball, the premier men’s club basketball competition in Europe.

The dataset contains information on EuroLeague teams, including their country, home city, arena, seating capacity, and historical performance (Final Four appearances and titles won).

The dataset is curated from publicly available sources such as Wikipedia and official EuroLeague records, and was packaged in the EuroleagueBasketball R package, with documentation available at natanast.github.io/EuroleagueBasketball.

"The EuroLeague is the top-tier European professional basketball club competition, widely regarded as the most prestigious competition in European basketball." — EuroLeague

**Questions**

 - Which countries are most represented in the EuroLeague?
 - How do arena capacities compare across teams and countries? In R, the readr::parse_number() function might be helpful here.
 - Which clubs have been the most successful historically?

Thank you to Natasa Anastasiadou for curating this week's dataset.

## Load Data

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| output: false

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-10-07')

euroleague_basketball <- tuesdata$euroleague_basketball |> 
    rename_with(str_to_lower) |> 
    rename_with(\(col_name) str_replace(col_name, " ", "_"))
```

## Wrangle

```{r}
#| label: wrangle-capacity

tb_capacity <- euroleague_basketball |>
    select(team, home_city, arena, capacity, country) |> 
    separate_longer_delim(c(arena, capacity), ", ") |> 
    mutate(capacity = as.integer(str_remove(capacity, ",")))
```


```{r}
#| label: wrangle-finalfour

tb_finalfour <- euroleague_basketball |> 
    select(
        team, home_city, last_season, country, 
        years_of_finalfour_appearances, years_of_titles_won
        ) |> 
    separate_longer_delim(years_of_finalfour_appearances, ", ") |> 
    separate_wider_delim(
        years_of_titles_won, ", ", 
        names_sep = "", too_few = "align_start"
        ) |> 
    mutate(
        won_title = if_any(
            contains("years_of_titles_won"), 
            \(year) year == years_of_finalfour_appearances
    )) |> 
    mutate(won_title = replace_na(won_title, F)) |> 
    select(-contains("years_of_titles_won")) |> 
    rename(final_four_appearance = years_of_finalfour_appearances)
```

# Exploratory Analysis

## Most Represented Countries

```{r}
#| label: fig-most-rep

euroleague_basketball |> 
    group_by(country) |> 
    count() |> 
    arrange(desc(n)) |> 
    ungroup() |> 
    mutate(country = fct_inorder(country)) |> 
    ggplot(aes(country, n, fill = country)) +
    geom_col() +
    labs(
        title = "Spain has more basketball teams in the EuroLeague than any other country.",
        y = "number of teams"
        ) +
    theme(
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Arena Capacities

```{r}
#| label: area-caps

tb_capacity_summary <- tb_capacity |> 
    distinct(arena, .keep_all = T) |> 
    group_by(country) |> 
    summarize(country_cap = sum(capacity)) |> 
    arrange(desc(country_cap)) |> 
    mutate(country = fct_inorder(country))

tb_capacity_factor <- tb_capacity |> 
    mutate(country = factor(country, levels = tb_capacity_summary$country)) |> 
    mutate(team = fct_reorder(
            team, capacity,
            sum, .desc = T
        )) |> 
    arrange(country, team, desc(capacity)) |> 
    mutate(arena = fct_inorder(arena))

tb_capacity_factor |> 
    distinct(arena, .keep_all = T) |> 
    ggplot(aes(country, capacity, fill = arena)) +
    geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity")
```
